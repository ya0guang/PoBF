# PoBF-Compliant Framework (PoCF) Reference Implementation

This repository contains all the codebase of the reference implementation of a PoBF-Compliant Framework (PoCF) where the term "PoBF" refers to *Proof of Being Forgotten*, a novel security and privacy properties for ensuring that in-TEE programs would not cause any leakage and secret residue.

## Citing the Paper

You can use the following bibtex code to cite our work.

}
```

## Prerequisites

### Hardware
To properly configure, install, and run the confidential computing task using the PoCF library, you need to have one of the following machines:

* A PC that supports SGX (we recommend that you use SGX2 for the best performance).
* A virtual machine that runs on a SEV host (such VMs can be rented from Azure).

### System Requirements

We have only tested PoCF on the following system. By its design, it is able to run on any Linux distribution, but due to some platform-specific designs, the compatilibty issue may occur.

* Ubuntu 20.04 (tested) /22.04 (may not work)

### Packages and Toolchains

0. Prepare

1. Install requires packages:

```sh
sudo apt install -y \
  build-essential \
  libtool \
  autoconf \
  python \
  curl \
  git \
  wget \
  python3 \
  python3-pip \
  cmake \
  libclang-dev \
  default-jdk \
  llvm-10
```

Note that if you want to plot correctly, please install tex-live by `sudo apt install -y texlive-full`. For a successful compilation of TVM, please install cmake >= 3.18:

```sh
wget -O - https://apt.kitware.com/keys/kitware-archive-latest.asc 2> /dev/null | gpg --dearmor - | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/kitware.gpg > /dev/null
sudo apt-add-repository 'deb https://apt.kitware.com/ubuntu/ focal main' 
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y cmake 
```

2. Install Rust:

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

In the root directory of this repository, run

```sh
rustup -V
```

which automatically reads the nightly toolchain version and installs the required toolchain version and components.

3. Prepare Python dependencies:

```sh
pip3 install -r ./requirements.txt
```

It is recommended that you manage the dependencies using Anaconda or pyenv.

### Verifiers

#### Coq

Please install `opam` first and install `coq` with opam:

```sh
# opam
bash -c "sh <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ocaml/opam/master/shell/install.sh)"
opam init
opam switch default
eval $(opam env)

# coq
opam pin add coq 8.13.2
opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
```

#### Mirai and Prusti

Please run the scripts at `./scripts`:

```sh
./prepare_mirai.sh
./prepare_prusti.sh
```

### TEE-specific Configurations

*If you are using SGX:* Please first install the required SGX SDK and libraries before building Rust library:

```sh
sudo echo 'deb [arch=amd64] https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/sgx_repo/ubuntu focal main' | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/intel-sgx.list
sudo wget -qO - https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/sgx_repo/ubuntu/intel-sgx-deb.key | apt-key add
sudo apt update && apt install -y \
  libsgx-epid \
  libsgx-quote-ex \
  libsgx-dcap-ql \
  libsgx-dcap-default-qpl \
  libsgx-uae-service \
  libsgx-urts-dbgsym \
  libsgx-enclave-common-dbgsym \
  libsgx-uae-service-dbgsym \
  libsgx-dcap-ql-dbgsym \
  libsgx-dcap-default-qpl-dbgsym

# Install SDK.
wget https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/sgx-linux/2.17.1/distro/ubuntu20.04-server/sgx_linux_x64_sdk_2.17.101.1.bin
chmod +x ./sgx_linux_x64_sdk_2.17.101.1.bin
sudo ./sgx_linux_x64_sdk_2.17.101.1.bin
```

The installation path of the SGX SDK is expected to be set to `/opt/intel`. Do *not* change it as doing so would break the build script of PoCF. Also do *not* install SDK other than the 2.17.1 version.

A one-shot installation and configuration script is located at the root directory:

```sh
./setup.sh
```

*If you want to use DCAP-baed remote attestation:*

1. Add yourself to `sgx_prv` group (if you do not do this, you need to execute the enclave program with sudo privilege):

```sh
sudo adduser `id -un` sgx_prv
```

You may need to re-login to allow the operation to take effect.

2. Register yourself as an Intel developer at [this portal](https://api.portal.trustedservices.intel.com/provisioning-certification) and subscribe to the Product IntelÂ® Software Guard Extensions Provisioning Certification Service.

Finally, follow the instructions in [DCAP Quick Installation Guide](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/intel-software-guard-extensions-data-center-attestation-primitives-quick-install-guide.html). You will be requested with a working key.

*If you are using SEV:* there is nothing to be configured.

## Verification towards PoCF

We provide a simple Python script under `pobf_verifier` that can verify:

- Whether `unsafe` is forbidden in the source code files.
- Whether OCALL(s) leak sensitive data.
- Whether Rust compiler can compile the code.
- Whether the implementation of the typestate is consistent with the abstract model.


Sample verification:

```sh
$ cd scripts && ./demo-verify.sh
- Check if Prusti is intalled.
  + Found Prusti.
- Verify the PoBF framework...

Indeed, the function source code of `sample_add` indeed has some potential leakage.

```rust
/// See `platform_sgx/enclave/src/userfunc.rs`.
pub fn sample_add(input: Vec<u8>) -> Vec<u8> {
    let step = 1;

    // MIRAI can detect this bug.
    #[cfg(feature = "leak_log")]
    {
        // Try remove this verified_log! Then MIRAI verifies.
        #[cfg(mirai)]
        verified_log!(SecretTaint, "The 0-th item is {} in sample_add", input[0]);
    }

    let mut output = Vec::new();
    for i in 0..input.len() {
        output.push(step + input[i]);
    }

    #[cfg(mirai)]
    add_tag!(&output, SecretTaint);

    output
}
```

Z3 will consume a lot of memory, and we are working on this issue.

## Build and Run on SGX

Currently we have the following CC tasks available (located under `cctasks`):

* `db`: The in-memory KV store build atop the `hashbrown` crate.
* `evaluation_tvm`: The ResNet-152 model deployed by Apache TVM.
* `fann`: The FANN task.
* `fasta`: The genomic sequence generator.
* `polybench`: A series of matrix algorithms for microbenchmarks.
* `sample_add`: A simple task that increments each element in a vector.

All these tasks are `no_std` and can be easily integrated in any environment.

> **Note**
>
> For the TVM task, please install TVM properly. The instruction can be found in [README.md](cctasks/evaluation_tvm/README.md).

All these tasks are optional dependencies of the PoCF application which can be selected using the Rust feature in the form of `task_*` (where `*` is the task name). For example, one runs the following command to compile the enclave program that executes the `fasta` task:

```sh
SGX_MODE=HW TASK=task_fasta make -j
```

The compiled binaries and libraries are located under `platform_sgx/{bin,lib}`. Then you can run the binary by

```sh
$ cd platform_sgx/bin
$ ls
app  enclave.signed.so  enclave.so
$ ./app 127.0.0.1 1234 # address and port
[2023-06-08T06:59:34Z INFO  app] [+] Listening to 127.0.0.1:1234
[2023-06-08T06:59:34Z INFO  app] [+] Initializing the enclave. May take a while...
[2023-06-08T07:00:03Z INFO  app] [+] Init Enclave Successful, eid: 2!
```

To connect to the remote enclave, you need to run the data provider. We provide with a sample data provider that can be found under `data_provider`. The following command build and run it with a custom manifest as its input.

```sh
cd data_provider && make -j
cd bin && ./data_provider run ../manifest.json
```

The manifest specifies the behavior of the data provider:

```json
{
  "address": "127.0.0.1",
  "port": 1234,
  // DCAP-based remote attestation does not require this field.
  "spid": "",
  // DCAP-based remote attestation does not require this field.
  "ias_key": "",
  "linkable": true,
  "data_path": "some/path/to/the/data",
  // 0 => EPID-based remote attestation.
  // 1 => DCAP-based remote attestation.
  "ra_type": 1
}
```

Some pre-generated data is located under `data/task_name/data.bin` along with the corresponding manifest file.
