# Configuration file for Prusti runtime.
# A Prusti.toml is optionally loaded from the current working directory prior to compilation. 
# This file is used to configure flags in Category B only and these flags apply to the entire
# compilation.
# Then, as each individual crate is checked (from the roots of the dependency tree) a Prusti.toml
# is optionally loaded from the directory where the crate's corresponding Cargo.toml is located.
# This file is used to configure flags in Category A only â€” it would not make sense to set e.g.
# NO_VERIFY_DEPS in a dependency since all of its dependencies have already been verified.
#
# Created by Haobin Chen and Hongbo Chen
# Prusti will load the keys from a cold start and will then cache it to ./target/verify/cache.bin.
# You may need to clean the cache before the configuration takes effect.
